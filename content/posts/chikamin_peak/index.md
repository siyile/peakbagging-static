> 3 days Snoqualmie Pass North Traverse [trip report](https://www.hippohamster.com/posts/snoqualmie_pass_north_traverse/)

This was Day 3, the final day of our Snoqualmie Pass North Traverse. Our plan was to summit Chikamin Peak and then return to the car at the Mineral Creek Trailhead. As usual, Chutang and I woke up at 6 a.m., made breakfast, and set out toward the peak. We had heard Chikamin was easier than Mount Thompson and Huckleberry Mountain, which we had climbed over the past two days, and that turned out to be true. The route was straightforward, and the short Class 3 chimney near the top was easy and not very technical.

We began by contouring around the lake but got a little confused right before the boulder field. After talking it over, we realized we needed to head up the boulders and pass the tall, thin rock visible from camp. From there, we climbed up until it was time to turn left toward the largest pond. I recommend staying on the right side of the creek at this point, where there is a faint but well-defined boot path that makes for easier walking. Once at rock above of the pond, you can either descend straight to it or contour slightly to the right.

From that point, the route was obvious. We followed the GPS up a gully, crossed a white slabby section, and continued climbing until we reached the ridge. A clear boot path from the ridge led us directly to the summit. The Class 3 chimney just below the top felt easy and safe. The summit offered fantastic views of Gold Creek Valley and the Snoqualmie region. It took us three hours to get there.

Unfortunately, there were clouds of mating bugs around the summit rocks, so we did not stay long. We retraced our steps back to Glacier Lake, completing the round trip in 5 hours and 45 minutes. The day was so hot that we jumped into Glacier Lake, enjoying a refreshing swim in a beautiful setting, which was a perfect way to end the off-trail portion of the trip.

Back at camp, we packed up our gear and hiked out on the Mineral Creek Trail without any issues. The trail follows the valley between Hibox Mountain and Three Queens, with each peak dominating one side of the valley. It is in excellent condition right now, with only two downed logs and no overgrowth, thanks to volunteer maintenance. We were relieved to reach the car at the trailhead and then drove back to Snoqualmie Pass to pick up our other car. It ended up being another ten-hour day, which made me understand why some people prefer to do Chikamin as a two-day trip.

Over three days, we summited one peak each day, enjoyed a comfortable pace, and soaked in the views of this beautiful region.
