As the weather forcast said cloudy weather through out the Cascades on Sunday, we are expecting cloud obstructured views everywhere. So we decide to do a short scramble. So if we are in the cloud all the time, it will still be a quick one. We learned that approach drive is diffcult, it is truely is. Large pot holes are in the middle of road that you can't really manuver and 12 miles rough unpaved road. We took choose to take the reportly better drive by drving down south from Darrington on Mountain Loop Highway for 10 miles, which is also the Google Map suggested route. It still took us 1 hour and 10 minutes to get to the base of climb. When you arrive at a relatively large and flat area right before TH, you can park there and walk maybe 200 ft to the TH. The parking space in TH is really small, it is hard for our Ram 1500 to turn around.

Aside from the driving, the climbing is quite pleasant. You will first walking on a good trail for around 1.4 miles, and then climb through a steep gulley/slope to the ridge. And then follow the relatively obvious trail to a point that you need to down climb a very easy 12 ft class 3 notch. After that, the summit is right ahead. There are carins along the way so the navigation is never difficult if you follow the trail and line of least resistance. I also found the slab the people talked about is not hard, at least when we did it in dry condition. And there should be a way around.

The summit is above the cloud, but there are parts that we are right in the cloud. It is expected before the trip, so we are okay with that. It took us around 5 hours round trip and 4.2 miles. If you are looking for a short outing with good views. This one may be for you!
