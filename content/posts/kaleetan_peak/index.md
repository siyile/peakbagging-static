We had a 9am late start from Frankline Falls Parking Lot. The lot was under construction last year which closes the trailhead. The lot is big and new with a lots of restrooms now!

The approach to the lake is around 4.4 miles, it took us 2:30 hours. The approach is rocky after crossing I-90 overpass, but grade is easy.

After the lake, we continued along the climbers trail. The trail is getting very steep, and sometimes easy to lose trail. But if you check the route on gaia, you should be able to quickly get back to trail. The crux would be the drop down to the high basin after gain the point 5699. The trail is muddy and slippery with lots of rocks. We found a better way when going back - when you need to drop down to the basin, look at climbers right, there is a new path to going down.

The rest trip to base of the final scramble is uneventful. And scramble to the summit we feel more like class 3, though there is a class 2 path, but it is too lose for us. Overall the final scramble is pleasant and enjoyable.

We took 5:10 hours from trailhead summit and logged 12.42 miles and 10:18 hours total.
